## The data

In the 'data' directory you'll find the data we'll be looking at tonight. It describes all road traffic accidents in Leeds from 2009 to 2015 that involve at least a minor injury. As you'll see, there are many interesting features to work with, including road surface conditions, lighting conditions, number of vehicles involved etc.

We've provided the raw files of the separate years, and additionally the following files:

## Challenges

Below we've described some suggested challenges (two for machine learning and three for visualization).
If you have an idea for something you'd rather work on, that's great! Run it by one of our team and
we can help you hash out a plan and get started

### Challenge 1: machine learning - Predicting Manchester Airbnb data

Description: use data features (existing or engineered) to develop a model that can predict Airbnb rental prices.

In the folder challenge 1, one will find the data

### Challenge 2: machine learning - Predicting car prices

Description: develop a time series model to fit and forecast the rate of accidents with time

## The data

In the 'data' directory you'll find the data we'll be looking at tonight. It describes all road traffic accidents in Leeds from 2009 to 2015 that involve at least a minor injury. As you'll see, there are many interesting features to work with, including road surface conditions, lighting conditions, number of vehicles involved etc. 

We've provided the raw files of the separate years, and additionally the following files:

## Challenges

Below we've described some suggested challenges (two for machine learning and three for visualization).
If you have an idea for something you'd rather work on, that's great! Run it by one of our team and 
we can help you hash out a plan and get started

### Challenge 1: machine learning - binary prediction

Description: use data features (existing or engineered) to develop a model that can predict casualty severity (slight vs serious)

Example of similar work: [Overview of a ML approach to a binary classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and [for some ideas](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-binary-classification-algorithms)

### Challenge 2: machine learning - time series modelling

Description: develop a time series model to fit and forecast the rate of accidents with time

Example of similar work: [A Time Series Model for Assessing the Trend and Forecasting the Road Traffic Accident Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5079210/)

### Challenge 3: visualization - mapping

Description: develop an interactive map, with filters, e.g. markers for accidents but only show those with at least 3 vehicles involved, or choose feature to enhance map (e.g. colour roads by severity)

Example of similar work: [Trafford Locality Assets](http://www.infotrafford.org.uk/assetmapping)

### Challenge 4: visualization - dashboard

Description: create an interactive dashboard exploring different ways of representing aspects of the dataset

Example of similar work: [Overview of NY oil and gas production](https://plot.ly/dash/gallery/new-york-oil-and-gas/)

### Challenge 5: visualization - infographic

Description: create a static infographic representing aspects of the dataset that interest you 

Example of similar work: [Compilation of traffic accident infographics](http://graphs.net/infographics-on-accidents.html)

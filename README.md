# JBCA Data Science Hack Night August 2017

Welcome to the 1st JBCA Data Science Hack Night.
For this hack night, each team will choose one of the following challenges and present a 3 minute presentation.
These presentations will be judged by the organisers and the winner will win the coveted Data Monkey Trophy!

The presentations will be judged on the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and visualisation/presentation of the data/results.

## Schedule

18.00 - 18.20: Welcome presentation

18.20 - 18.30: Forming teams

18.30 - 19.15: **first half**

19.15 - 19.30: Pizza!

19.30 - 20.30: **second half**

20.30 - 20.50: Lightning presentations from teams

20.50 - 21.00: Judging and prizes


## The challenges

Below we've described two different challenges for which each team will pick one to work on.


### Challenge 1: Machine learning - Predicting Manchester Airbnb data

Description: use data features (existing or engineered) to develop a model that can predict Airbnb rental prices.

The root mean squared error using K-Fold cross validation is a good way to test the accuracy of the model.

In the folder challenge 1, one will find the data in the csv file 'listings.csv'. A short tutorial introducing the data,running a very simple linear regression model and performing k-cross validation is found in 'AIRBNB_tutorial.ipynb'.

The original source of this data is located at:

### Challenge 2: Machine learning - Predicting car prices

Description:
